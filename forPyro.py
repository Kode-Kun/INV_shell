Steps: 
1. Go in the feature1 branch and create pandasMain.py in that branch
2. Do all the panadas things in pandasMain.py (initiating it, etc.)
3. Create function that creates new excel file 
4. (optional) add other fancy stuff like writing in the excel file (again, all in its own function)
5. import pandasMain.py in main.py
6. Add all functions we'll be calling from the shell in the func_dict variable. (look at how the other function references are written in the dictionary)
7. Test run
8. Get some sleep
